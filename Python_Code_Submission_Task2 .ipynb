    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This assignment focuses on analyzing the usage patterns and availability of bike stations in Dublin. The primary data source for this analysis is the real-time bike data, which was retreived through the API hosted by JCDecaux. This dataset provides up-to-date information on bike availability and station occupancy across the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "The real-time bike dataset includes crucial attributes such as:\n",
    "- **Station_ID**: A unique identifier for each bike station.\n",
    "- **Station_Name**: The name of each bike station.\n",
    "- **Total_No_of_bikes_stands**: The total number of bike stands available at each station.\n",
    "- **Available_bikes**: The number of bikes available at each station at a given time.\n",
    "- **Last_update**: The timestamp of the latest update for bike availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of the Analysis\n",
    "The primary goals of this analysis are to:\n",
    "1. **Identify Usage Patterns**: Determine peak usage times and patterns across different stations.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate Availability**: Analyze the availability of bikes at various stations to understand supply and demand dynamics.\n",
    "3. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Provide recommendations for improving bike distribution and availability, enhancing user satisfaction.\n",

    "# Task 1: Development Plan\n",
    "## Objectives and Questions\n",
    "The goal of this development plan is to outline the objectives of our analysis of Dublin's bike station data. By setting clear goals and posing relevant questions, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can optimize the city's bike-sharing program.Our analysis will focus on the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which Stations are Most Frequently Used?**\n",
    "   To identify the bike stations with the highest usage rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are Stations with Banking Functionality More Frequently Used Than Others?** To Compare usage rates between stations with and without banking functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the Busiest Times of the Day and Days of the Week?** To determine peak usage times throughout the day and identify the busiest days of the week.days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How Does the Availability of Bikes Compare to the Total Capacity of Stands?** To Analyze the ratio of available bikes to the total capacity of bike stands at each station.ands at each station.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Does Bike Usage Increase During Weekends Compared to Weekdays?** To investigate if there is a significant increase in bike usage on weekends.n bike usage on weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Are There Specific Times of Day When Bikes are More Likely to be Unavailable?** To identify times of day with the highest likelihood of bike unavailability.ihood of bike unavailability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Are There Patterns Where Stations Run Out of Bikes Completely?** To examine the frequency and patterns of stations running out of bikes.of stations running out of bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are the Peak Usage Times for Bike Stations (e.g., Morning Rush, Evening Rush)?** To identify the exact times during the day when bike usage peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Are There Specific Stations Consistently Underutilized or Overutilized?** To identify stations with consistently low or high usage rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Which Station is the Busiest Each Day?** To determine the busiest station for each day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions, we aim to uncover actionable insights that will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Dublin's bike-sharing program. This development plan provides a clear and coherent roadmap for our analysis, ensuring that we achieve our objectives and contribute valuable information to city planners and program managers."
