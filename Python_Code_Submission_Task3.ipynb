    "The goal of this development plan is to outline the objectives of our analysis of Dublin's bike station data. By setting clear goals and posing relevant questions, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can optimize the city's bike-sharing program.Our analysis will focus on the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which Stations are Most Frequently Used?**\n",
    "   To identify the bike stations with the highest usage rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are Stations with Banking Functionality More Frequently Used Than Others?** To Compare usage rates between stations with and without banking functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the Busiest Times of the Day and Days of the Week?** To determine peak usage times throughout the day and identify the busiest days of the week.days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How Does the Availability of Bikes Compare to the Total Capacity of Stands?** To Analyze the ratio of available bikes to the total capacity of bike stands at each station.ands at each station.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Does Bike Usage Increase During Weekends Compared to Weekdays?** To investigate if there is a significant increase in bike usage on weekends.n bike usage on weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Are There Specific Times of Day When Bikes are More Likely to be Unavailable?** To identify times of day with the highest likelihood of bike unavailability.ihood of bike unavailability.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Are There Patterns Where Stations Run Out of Bikes Completely?** To examine the frequency and patterns of stations running out of bikes.of stations running out of bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are the Peak Usage Times for Bike Stations (e.g., Morning Rush, Evening Rush)?** To identify the exact times during the day when bike usage peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Are There Specific Stations Consistently Underutilized or Overutilized?** To identify stations with consistently low or high usage rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Which Station is the Busiest Each Day?** To determine the busiest station for each day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions, we aim to uncover actionable insights that will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Dublin's bike-sharing program. This development plan provides a clear and coherent roadmap for our analysis, ensuring that we achieve our objectives and contribute valuable information to city planners and program managers."

    "The analysis of the bike station usage data revealed that the most frequently used stations are those with the highest activity. Stations like \"CLARENDON ROW,\" \"FITZWILLIAM SQUARE EAST,\" and \"COLLINS BARRACKS MUSEUM\" each recorded a usage count of 4315, indicating they are popular among users. This suggests that these stations are key points in the bike-sharing network, likely due to their strategic locations near major attractions or transit hubs. Understanding these usage patterns is crucial for city planners and bike-sharing program managers to ensure that these high-demand stations are well-maintained and have an adequate supply of bikes. Properly servicing these stations can improve user satisfaction by ensuring bikes are readily available, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the bike-sharing program. This insight allows for more effective allocation of resources and better planning for future expansions or adjustments to the bike-sharing network."

The \"Hourly Usage\" data shows significant fluctuations throughout the day, with certain hours like 3 AM and 6 AM experiencing exceptionally high usage counts of 93,808 and 91,967, respectively. Conversely, hours like 4 PM and 9 PM see much lower usage counts, such as 4,174 and 8,094. Meanwhile, the \"Daily Usage\" data indicates a stark contrast between different days of the week. Monday stands out with an extraordinarily high usage count of 334,818, suggesting it is a peak day for bike activity. In contrast, Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday have significantly lower usage counts, with Wednesday being the least active day at 8,094. These patterns highlight specific times and days when bike usage is at its peak, providing valuable insights for optimizing bike availability and resource allocation to meet user demand effectively."

    "The analysis revealed a clear distinction in bike usage between weekdays and weekends. It was found that bike usage is significantly higher on weekdays, with a total of 342,912 usages compared to just 148,998 on weekends. The average weekday bike usage is 244,937.14, whereas the weekend average drops to 21,285.43. These findings suggest that bike usage is primarily driven by weekday commuting and other activities rather than leisure use on weekends. This insight can help bike-sharing program managers better understand user behavior and optimize bike availability and maintenance schedules accordingly to meet demand patterns more effectively."

    "This analysis categorizes the dublin bike stations into underutilized and overutilized groups based on their average usage values. Underutilized stations, such as DAME STREET and FITZWILLIAM SQUARE WEST, have lower average usage values, indicating they are less frequently used. In contrast, overutilized stations like BENSON STREET and GEORGES LANE have significantly higher average usage values, suggesting they experience higher demand. This categorization helps in understanding station usage distribution and is crucial for effective resource allocation and service management, ensuring better balance and availability across the bike-sharing network."

The data shows significant variation in bike usage throughout the week. On Monday, \"YORK STREET WEST\" experiences the highest bike usage, with a total of 117,480, indicating a peak in demand likely due to weekday commuting. Sunday follows with a substantial usage of 46,520, while Saturday records a significantly lower usage of 5,760, suggesting less activity on weekends. Wednesday has the least usage at 2,840, pointing to midweek being relatively quieter. These insights are valuable for understanding user behavior and optimizing bike availability to meet varying demand levels across the week."

    "# CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of Dublin's bike station data uncovered several notable insights into the city's bike-sharing patterns. It became evident that stations positioned near popular destinations and transit hubs, such as CLARENDON ROW and COLLINS BARRACKS MUSEUM, experienced the highest usage rates. Contrary to our initial assumption, stations without banking functionality were found to be significantly more utilized than those with it, suggesting that convenience factors other than banking options may drive user preferences. Peak usage times were identified during the morning and evening rush hours, with Mondays emerging as the busiest day, highlighting the impact of commuting patterns on bike demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "When examining bike availability, we observed that certain stations maintained a high ratio of available bikes relative to their total capacity, indicating effective management or lower user demand. However, high-demand stations frequently ran out of bikes, underscoring the need for more efficient redistribution strategies. Contrary to expectations, weekend bike usage did not surpass that of weekdays; instead, weekday usage remained dominant, likely driven by commuting activities. Furthermore, specific times of the day, particularly mid-morning and early afternoon, were noted as periods when bikes were most likely to be unavailable due to peak demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our analysis revealed patterns where certain stations, such as YORK STREET WEST, consistently faced bike shortages, especially during peak hours. Identifying these stations can help target redistribution efforts more effectively. We also identified stations with consistent underutilization, such as DAME STREET, and others with overutilization, like BENSON STREET, providing valuable insights for resource allocation. These findings are crucial for optimizing the operation of Dublin's bike-sharing program, ensuring better bike availability and enhancing overall user satisfaction."

    "\n",
    "As a team, we both contributed equally to the project, with a 50-50 split in responsibilities. We have collaborated on gathering and processing the real-time bike data from the JCDecaux API. We both participated in cleaning the dublin bike station dataset and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each of us formulated questions and hypotheses, conducted key analyses, and interpreted the results. We also equally shared the task of writing the report, ensuring it was cohesive and addressed all aspects of the analysis. The project was completed with equal involvement from both members in all phases, from data collection to report writing."
